Description: Supports land use planning, management, conservation, and 
    community engagement by projecting the net impacts of alternative scenarios 
    of land cover change on multiple benefits of interest, such as wildlife 
    distributions and ecosystem services associated with land covers. It applies
    existing models to user-supplied landscapes and compares to a baseline 
    landscape to project the net change for each benefit. It also summarizes the 
    net change for multiple benefits to communicate synergies and trade-offs 
    among benefits of interest under each scenario.
