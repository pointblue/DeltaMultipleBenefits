Description: Supports land use planning, management, conservation, and
    community engagement in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta by
    providing tools for applying existing models and data to user-supplied
    landscapes and estimate the multiple benefits resulting from each
    landscape, such as metrics representing agricultural livelihoods,
    water quality, climate change resilience, and biodiversity support
    associated with individual land covers.  It was designed to compare
    the metrics resulting from a baseline landscape representing current
    conditions to those from a projected landscape under a proposed or
    anticipated future scenario. The results provide insights into the net
    change in each metric expected from a change in the landscape and the
    synergies and trade-offs among multiple metrics.
