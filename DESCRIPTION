Description: Supports land use planning, management, conservation, and 
    community engagement in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta by providing
    tools for applying existing models and data to user-supplied landscapes and 
    estimate the multiple benefits resulting from each landscape, such as 
    metrics representing agricultural livelihoods, water quality, climate change
    resilience, and biodiversity support associated with individual land covers. 
    It was designed to compare the metrics resulting from a baseline landscape 
    representing current conditions to those from a projected landscape under a 
    proposed or anticipated future scenario. The results provide insights into 
    the net change in each metric expected from a change in the landscape and 
    the synergies and trade-offs among multiple metrics.
