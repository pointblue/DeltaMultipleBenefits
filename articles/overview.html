</h2>
<p>Achieving the long-term vision of a resilient Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta ecosystem requires meeting multiple goals simultaneously,
including self-sustaining wildlife populations and thriving communities
of people in an evolving landscape. However, to effectively plan and
implement policies and land management decisions intended to achieve
multiple goals, it is essential to be able to identify the potential
trade-offs of changes to the landscape across multiple goals. Meeting
this challenge would support effective policy and resource management
decisions and address several science priorities identified in Science
Action Agendas for the Delta.</p>
<p>To help meet this challenge, we built on our partnerships in the
Delta and broader Central Valley and on our expertise in
multiple-benefit conservation and avian ecology in agricultural
landscapes to develop a science-based framework for projecting the net
impact of landscape changes on multiple metrics representing goals for
the Delta ecosystem. Our ultimate goals were to support communication
among Delta community members about the projected benefits and
trade-offs of proposed or anticipated changes to the landscape, to
support effective decision-making and policy to reach the Delta Plan’s
multiple goals.</p>

</h2>
<p>In Phase 1 of this project, <em>Trade-offs and Co-benefits of
Landscape Change on Bird Communities and Ecosystem Services in the
Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta</em>, we established the foundations
of our framework as the <em>DeltaMultipleBenefits</em> R package, now
freely available for use and further development.</p>
<ul>
<li>We identified a suite of benefits categories and multiple
quantifiable metrics to represent each category, which included
compiling existing public data and analyzing thousands of existing bird
survey data to build species distribution models for a suite of riparian
landbird and waterbird species.</li>
<li>We also worked with partners to identify two key drivers of
landscape change of interest to investigate: habitat restoration and
perennial crop expansion. We developed three alternative landscapes
based on anticipated changes to the landscape from each driver in
isolation and both drivers in combination.</li>
<li>We estimated the net effects of each alternative landscape on each
metric in comparison to a baseline landscape to identify co-benefits and
trade-offs of each alternative.</li>
<li>We generalized these analyses into the Delta Multiple Benefits R
package, allowing users to repeat our analyses, adapt them to new
alternative landscapes and scenarios, and incorporate their own metrics
and data.</li>
</ul>
<p>This phase was funded by Proposition 1 Delta Water Quality and
Ecosystem Restoration Program, Grant Agreement Number – Q1996022,
administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. All
data, models, metrics, publications, and reports from Phase 1 are <a href="articles/supporting_information.html">available for
download</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>In Phase 2 of this project, <em>Trade-offs and Co-benefits of
Landscape Change in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta: Phase II
Tidal Wetlands and Restoration</em>, we are extending this framework to
include Suisun Marsh and address tidal wetland restoration scenarios.
The Delta Plan has defined targets for increasing the area of natural
vegetation communities by 2050, including restoring more than 30,000
acres of tidal wetland habitat. Meeting this target is expected to
support diverse populations of native species, improve ecological
processes and functions, and enhance resilience to climate change, but
the actual benefits of meeting this target are likely to depend on where
and how tidal wetlands are restored.</p>
<p>We are leading research to estimate the potential benefits of tidal
wetland restoration for the Delta’s bird community, by: - collecting new
bird survey data in tidal wetlands and building new species distribution
models to represent the habitat value of tidal wetland restoration. -
working with partners to develop tidal wetland restoration scenarios for
evaluation. - updating the Delta Multiple Benefits package with these
new models and data, allowing users to repeat our analyses, adapt them
to new alternative landscapes and scenarios, and incorporate their own
metrics and data.</p>
<p>This phase is funded by the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure
Improvement Act of 2014 (Proposition 1, CWC § 79707), grant agreement
number Q2296017, administered by the California Department of Fish and
Wildlife.</p>

</h2>
<p>Our vision is to continue developing this framework to represent a
more comprehensive range of goals for the Delta ecosystem and important
metrics representing each goal, and support the evaluation of new
scenarios and alternative landscapes as they are identified and
developed. As an R package, this framework is designed to readily
incorporate additional species, models, data, and metrics, and can be
readily applied to new scenarios and alternative landscapes.</p>
<p>We are currently seeking input on the next phase of development for
this project: - What kinds of landscape changes would you be interested
in having analyzed? - Which additional metrics or species would be
useful to incorporate? - Which metrics should be refined with new data
or better models? - Other suggestions?</p>
<p>Please contact us to collaborate on further development!</p>
