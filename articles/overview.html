</h2>
<p>Achieving the long-term vision of a resilient Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta ecosystem requires meeting multiple goals simultaneously,
including self-sustaining wildlife populations and thriving communities
of people in an evolving landscape. However, to effectively plan and
implement policies and land management decisions intended to achieve
multiple goals, it is essential to be able to identify the potential
trade-offs of changes to the landscape across multiple goals. Meeting
this challenge would support effective policy and resource management
decisions and address several science priorities identified in Science
Action Agendas for the Delta.</p>
<p>To help meet this challenge, we built on our partnerships in the
Delta and broader Central Valley and on our expertise in
multiple-benefit conservation and avian ecology in agricultural
landscapes to develop a science-based framework for projecting the net
impact of landscape changes on multiple metrics representing goals for
the Delta ecosystem. Our ultimate goals were to support communication
among Delta community members about the projected benefits and
trade-offs of proposed or anticipated changes to the landscape, to
support effective decision-making and policy to reach the Delta Plan’s
multiple goals.</p>

</h2>
<p>In Phase 1 of this project, <em>Trade-offs and Co-benefits of
Landscape Change on Bird Communities and Ecosystem Services in the
Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta</em>, we established the foundations
of our framework as the <em>DeltaMultipleBenefits</em> R package, now
freely available for use and further development. We identified a suite
of benefits categories and multiple quantifiable metrics to represent
each category, which included compiling existing public data and
analyzing thousands of existing bird survey data to build species
distribution models for a suite of riparian landbird and waterbird
species. We also worked with partners to identify two key drivers of
landscape change of interest to investigate: habitat restoration and
perennial crop expansion. We developed three alternative landscapes
based on anticipated changes to the landscape from each driver in
isolation and both drivers in combination, and we estimated the net
impacts of each alternative landscape on each metric in comparison to a
baseline landscape. This phase was funded by Proposition 1 Delta Water
Quality and Ecosystem Restoration Program, Grant Agreement Number –
Q1996022, administered by the California Department of Fish and
Wildlife. All data, models, metrics, publications, and reports from
Phase 1 are <a href="articles/supporting_information.html">available for
download</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>In Phase 2 of this project, <em>Trade-offs and Co-benefits of
Landscape Change in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta: Phase II
Tidal Wetlands and Restoration</em>, we are building on Phase 1 by
incorporating new bird survey data in tidal wetlands and building new
species distribution models to represent the habitat value of tidal
wetland restoration. We are also working with partners to develop tidal
wetland restoration scenarios for evaluation. <a href="articles/tidal_wetland_restoration.html">More information</a>.
This phase is funded by the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure
Improvement Act of 2014 (Proposition 1, CWC § 79707), grant agreement
number Q2296017, administered by the California Department of Fish and
Wildlife.</p>

</h2>
<p>Our vision is to continue developing this framework to represent a
more comprehensive range of goals for the Delta ecosystem and important
metrics representing each goal, and support the evaluation of new
scenarios and alternative landscapes as they are identified and
developed. As an R package, this framework is designed to readily
incorporate additional species, models, data, and metrics, and can be
readily applied to new scenarios and alternative landscapes. Please
contact us to collaborate on further development!</p>
