## Introduction

The `DeltaMultipleBenefits` R package serves as an open-source, science-based framework for estimating the net impacts of scenarios of landscape change on multiple metrics of interest. It is intended to support land use planning, management, conservation, and community engagement in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta by identifying potential benefits and trade-offs of proposed or anticipated changes in land cover.

**Your help is needed! We are currently seeking input on approaches to developing tidal wetland restoration scenarios. Please see [our recent article](articles/tidal_wetland_restoration.html) for more information.**


## Installation

````{=html}
<!--You can install the released version of DeltaMultipleBenefits from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:-->
````

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pointblue/DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```

## How to use

This package provides tools for evaluating land cover rasters supplied by the user to estimate the magnitude of the benefits associated with each landscape and the differences in benefits among landscapes, such as between current baseline land cover and a proposed or anticipated alternative land cover.

### Benefit Categories and Metrics

The benefit categories currently addressed include: Agricultural Livelihoods, Water Quality, Climate Change Resilience, and Biodiversity Support. Each category is represented by multiple metrics, currently one of two types:

-   **simple metrics:** quantitative values or qualitative scores assigned to each land cover class and summarized over the entire landscape

-   **spatial models:** models that require information about the spatial distribution of land covers to estimate a total value, such as the total suitable habitat estimated from a species distribution model

All simple metrics and species distribution models that have already been developed for this framework are available for download:

*This framework is still in development and designed to readily incorporate additional species, models, data, and metrics. Please contact us to collaborate on incorporating additional metrics or data.*

### Scenarios & Alternative Landscapes

By comparing landscape totals for each metric estimated from a baseline landscape and alternative landscapes representing proposed or anticipated changes, the expected direction and magnitude of the net change in each metric is estimated. In the initial development of this framework, we built simple alternative landscapes representing changes driven by one or two individual drivers of landscape change, allowing evaluation of their individual impacts. However, more complex and realistic scenarios of future landscape change can also be evaluated.

All landscapes that have already been developed for this framework are available for download, including a baseline landscape, a restoration landscape representing Delta Plan restoration targets for non-tidal wetlands and riparian habitat, a perennial crop expansion landscape, and a combination of restoration and perennial crop expansion.

### Evaluating New Scenarios

This package includes a vignette that serves as a tutorial outlining the major steps of analyzing alternative Delta landscapes and comparing them to each other, including:

1.  Preparing new landscape scenarios for analysis
2.  Summarizing the net change in the total area of each land cover class
3.  Estimating the net change in simple metrics
4.  Estimating the net change in metrics informed by spatial models
