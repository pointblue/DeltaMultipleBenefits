The `DeltaMultipleBenefits` package supports estimating the net impacts of scenarios of landscape change in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to identify projected benefits and trade-offs across multiple metrics.

This package supports land use planning, management, conservation, and community engagement in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta by providing tools for applying existing models and data to user-supplied landscapes to estimate a range of benefits to the Delta community and compare a baseline landscape to proposed or anticipated future landscape scenarios. Currently, the benefit categories addressed include: Agricultural Livelihoods, Water Quality, Climate Change Resilience, and Biodiversity Support. Each category is represented by multiple individual metrics, representing either values applied to each land cover class and summarized over the entire landscape or the total amount of suitable habitat projected from species distribution models. By comparing landscape totals for each metric estimated from a baseline landscape and alternative scenarios of future landscape change, the expected direction and magnitude of the net change in each metric is estimated. 

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of DeltaMultipleBenefits from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pointblue/DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```
## How to use

This package includes a vignette that serves as a tutorial outlining the major steps of analyzing alternative Delta landscapes and comparing them to each other, including:  

1. Preparing new landscape scenarios for analysis 
2. Summarizing the net change in the total area of each land cover class
3. Estimating the net change in simple metrics  
4. Estimating the net change in metrics informed by spatial models
