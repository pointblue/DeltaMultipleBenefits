# DeltaMultipleBenefits

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of DeltaMultipleBenefits is to supports land use planning, management, conservation, and community engagement in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River 
Delta. This package provides tools for applying existing models and data to 
user-supplied landscapes to estimate the multiple benefits resulting from each 
landscape, such as metrics representing agricultural livelihoods, water quality, 
climate change resilience, and biodiversity support associated with individual 
land covers. It was designed to compare the metrics resulting from a baseline 
landscape representing current conditions to those from a projected landscape 
under a proposed or anticipated future scenario. The results provide insights 
into the net change in each metric expected from a change in the landscape and 
the synergies and trade-offs among multiple metrics. 

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of DeltaMultipleBenefits from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pointblue/DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(DeltaMultipleBenefits)
## basic example code to be filled in here
```

<!--What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.-->
