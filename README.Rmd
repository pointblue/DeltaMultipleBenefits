The `DeltaMultipleBenefits` package facilitates estimating the net impacts of scenarios of landscape change in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, and was developed with funding from the Proposition 1 Delta Water Quality and Ecosystem Restoration Program administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Grant Agreement Number–Q1996022). 

The package provides tools for applying existing data and species distribution models to user-supplied landscapes to estimate a range of benefits to the Delta community and how they compare to other landscapes. Currently, the benefit categories addressed include: Agricultural Livelihoods, Water Quality, Climate Change Resilience, and Biodiversity Support. Each category is represented by multiple individual metrics that can be summarized over the entire landscape. By comparing metrics estimated from proposed scenarios of landscape change to metrics estimated for a baseline landscape representing current conditions, the expected net change in each metric can be estimated. 

Ultimately, this R package is intended to facilitate a more comprehensive multidimensional understanding of the direction and magnitude of the potential impacts of landscape change (proposed or anticipated), communication about the projected synergies and trade-offs among multiple goals, and the identification of solutions to address these trade-offs.

## How to use

This package includes a vignette that serves as a tutorial outlining the major steps of analyzing alternative Delta landscapes and comparing them to each other, including:  

1. Preparing new landscape scenarios for analysis 
2. Summarizing the net change in the total area of each land cover class
3. Estimating the net change in simple metrics  
4. Estimating the net change in metrics informed by spatial models
