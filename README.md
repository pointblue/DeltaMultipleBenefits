# DeltaMultipleBenefits

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of DeltaMultipleBenefits is to supports land use planning,
management, conservation, and community engagement by projecting the net
impacts of alternative scenarios of land cover change on multiple
benefits of interest, such as wildlife distributions and ecosystem
services associated with land covers. It applies existing models to
user-supplied landscapes and compares to a baseline landscape to project
the net change for each benefit. It also summarizes the net change for
multiple benefits to communicate synergies and trade-offs among benefits
of interest under each scenario.

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of DeltaMultipleBenefits from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:-->

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pointblue/DeltaMultipleBenefits")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(DeltaMultipleBenefits)
## basic example code to be filled in here
```

<!--What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


```r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.-->
